# 🫀 LVH Detection from Chest X-Rays

This web app detects **Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)** using a deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images. It uses Grad-CAM to visualize the areas influencing the prediction.

## 📦 Pretrained Models

Looking to test the model with real predictions?

👉 Head over to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/Beyonder016/lvh-gradio/releases)** to download the latest pretrained model weights.

**Available models:**
- `resnet18_best.pth`
- `resnet18_balanced.pth`
- `resnet18_91acc.pth`

Each model comes with a description to help you choose the best fit for your use case.

> 📌 Note: Place the `.pth` file in the `model/` folder after downloading.

## 🧪 Try with Sample Images

To quickly test the model, use these folders:

- 📂 [samples/LVH](samples/LVH) — X-rays with confirmed LVH  
- 📂 [samples/No_LVH](samples/No_LVH) — X-rays without LVH

👉 Download any image and upload it in the [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Beyonder016/lvh-gradio) interface to see predictions and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload a `.jpg` or `.png` chest X-ray  
2. The model predicts: **LVH** or **No LVH**  
3. A heatmap highlights the region used for the prediction
